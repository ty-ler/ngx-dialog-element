# ngx-dialog-element

An Angular primitive library which allows easy implementation of dialogs (modals). This library takes advantage of the `<dialog>` element in HTML.

# Dialog element

The `<dialog>` HTML element implements most of the functionality needed when it comes to a dialog/modal. It takes care of things like accessibility concerns, and allows for easy styling of the dialog backdrop. One of the biggest benefits is the ease of creating dialog animations using just basic CSS animations.
